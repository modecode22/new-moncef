## Introducing Speeq: A Humble Start to Voice Translation

Hello, I'm the developer behind **Speeq**. It's a small project I've started to explore the realm of real-time voice translation. While it currently offers basic functionality, I see it as a foundational step in a longer journey. Let's look at what Speeq currently brings to the table.

### Technologies Behind Speeq

- **Desktop Integration**: Tauri
- **Frontend**: React ,TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

### What Speeq Can Do Now

- **Basic Voice Translation**: Speeq can translate voice inputs in its current phase. It's simple but effective.
- **Potential for Platform Integration**: The vision is to eventually integrate with platforms such as Discord and Zoom.


### The Speeq Website: An Introduction and Design Showcase

I've also crafted a [website for Speeq](https://speeq.vercel.app/), which not only introduces the app but also showcases the design system I've built specifically for it.

It's a testament to the cohesive visual identity I envision for Speeq as it grows and evolves. The site is minimalist yet informative, reflecting the core ethos of the project.


### The Path Forward

Speeq, in its current state, offers only the foundational functionalities. There's much to be done, and I'm open to feedback, insights, and collaborations to help it grow.

### Join the Journey

While Speeq is still in its early days, I believe in its potential to grow into something much bigger. If you're interested in seeing where this can go, or have any suggestions to offer, I'd love to hear them.
